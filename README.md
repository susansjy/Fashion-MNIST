# Fashion-MNIST
A CNN model with the Fashion-MNIST using the PyTorch

## Dataset
[Fashion-MNIST](https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist]) is a dataset of [Zalando](https://jobs.zalando.com/tech/)'s article imagesâ€”consisting of a training set of 60,000 examples and a test set of 10,000 examples. Each example is a 28x28 grayscale image, associated with a label from 10 classes.


## My model
Classfier: 3 Convolutional, 2 pooling, 2 Fully-connected

Preprocessing: Normalization, random horizontal flip, random crops


## Test accuracy
0.8613
